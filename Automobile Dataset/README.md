## Summary
The dataset contains information about various automobile characteristics, insurance risk ratings, and normalized losses. The data was sourced from multiple references, including the 1985 Ward's Automotive Yearbook, Personal Auto Manuals from the Insurance Services Office, and the Insurance Collision Report from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.

The Automobile Dataset serves as an exemplar for the different stages of data analysis.
