# Data Analysis of Pima Indians Diabetes Patients

The Pima Indian Diabetes Dataset, originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, contains information of 768 women from a population near Phoenix, Arizona, USA. The outcome tested was Diabetes, 258 tested positive and 500 tested negative. Therefore, there is one target (dependent) variable and the following attributes:

- Pregnancies (number of times pregnant),

- Oral glucose tolerance test - OGTT (two hour plasma glucose concentration after 75g anhydrous glucose in mg/dl),

- Blood Pressure (Diastolic Blood Pressure in mmHg),

- Skin Thickness (Triceps skin fold thickness in mm),

- Insulin (2 h serum insulin in mu U/ml),

- BMI (Body Mass Index in kg/m2),

- Age (years),

- Pedigree Diabetes Function ('function that represents how likely they are to get the disease by extrapolating from their ancestor’s history')

The Pima population has been under study by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases at intervals of 2 years since 1965. As epidemiological evidence indicates that T2DM results from interaction of genetic and environmental factors, the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset includes information about attributes that could and should be related to the onset of diabetes and its future complications.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to determine (or diagnostically predict) whether or not a person from Pima community has diabetes. However from a broader perspective, it becomes imperative that we also take the following into consideration:

- Analyse the dataset under the point of view of a Dietitian
- Apply machine learning techniques resulting in bridging the gap between datasets and human knowledge.

Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years of age of Pima Indian heritage. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years of age of Pima Indian heritage.
