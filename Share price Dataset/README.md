# Extracting and Visualizing Stock Data

In this project, I will assume the role of a Data Scientist/Data Analyst at a newly established hedge fund investment firm dedicated to assisting customers in making stock investments. I'm tasked to extract financial data like historical share price and quarterly revenue reportings from various sources using Python libraries and webscraping on popular stocks. After collecting this data we will visualize it in a dashboard to identify patterns or trends. The stocks we will work with are Tesla and GameStop.

## Dashboard

After extracting the company key performance indicators (KPIs) using WebScraping, a dashboard was developed to analyse the Tesla and GameStop stock graphs. These graphs consist of historical quarterly/yearly revenue data and historical share prices.
