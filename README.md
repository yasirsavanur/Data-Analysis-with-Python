# Data Analysis with Python <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/roshangrewal/IBM-Data-Science-Professional-Certification/master/IBM-Banner.png" align="right" width="120" />


## Summary 
This course emphasises on Python as a primary tool in order to work with various types of data. Some of the key concepts included in the course are - preparing data for analysis, performing simple statistical analysis, creating meaningful data visualizations, predicting future trends from data, and more. It concludes with a [final assignment](https://github.com/yasirsavanur/Capstone-Projects/blob/main/Data%20Analysis%20with%20Python/Project/House%20Sales%20in%20King%20County.ipynb) predicting of the market prices of houses based on a detailed dataset. Each notebook here is incredibly detailed, and they collectively show the full process of predictive analysis. Some topics, such as data wrangling, have additional associated notebooks, due to the breadth of content covered in this course. 


## Key Topics 
- [Importing datasets](https://github.com/yasirsavanur/Capstone-Projects/blob/main/Data%20Analysis%20with%20Python/1-%20Importing%20Datasets.ipynb)

  - Understanding the data
  - Importing and exporting data in Python


- [Data wrangling](https://github.com/yasirsavanur/Capstone-Projects/blob/main/Data%20Analysis%20with%20Python/2-%20Data%20Wrangling.ipynb)

  - Identifying and handling missing values
  - Data formatting
  - Data normalization
  - Binning
  - Indicator variables
  
- [Exploratory Data Analysis]()

  - Summarizing main characteristics of the data
  - Gaining better understanding of the data set
  - Uncovering relationships between the variables
  - Extracting important variables
  
- [Model Development]()

  - Simple and Multiple Linear Regression
  - Model Evaluation Using Visualization
  - Polynomial Regression and Pipelines
  - R-squared and MSE for In-Sample Evaluation
  - Prediction and Decision Making
  
- [Model Evaluation and Refinement]()

  - Over-fitting, under-fitting and model selection
  - Ridge regression

- [EDA - Dataprep]()

  - DataPrep is an open-source library available for python that lets you prepare your data using a single library with only a few lines of code. 
  - DataPrep can be used to address multiple data-related problems, and the library provides numerous features through which every problem can be solved and taken care of.

- [ETL - Data Engineering]()

  - Working with different file formats - (JSON, CSV, XLSX etc.)
  - There are various formats for a dataset, .csv, .json, .xlsx etc. The dataset can be stored in different places, on your local machine or sometimes online.
