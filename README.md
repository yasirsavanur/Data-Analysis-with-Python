# Data Analysis with Python <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/roshangrewal/IBM-Data-Science-Professional-Certification/master/IBM-Banner.png" align="right" width="120" />


## Summary 
This course emphasizes Python as the primary tool for working with various types of data. It covers key concepts such as preparing data for analysis, performing simple statistical analysis, creating meaningful data visualizations, and predicting future trends from data. The course essentially includes projects where one uses Python to:
- Predict and analyse the market prices of houses based on a detailed dataset
- Analyse a certain community diabetes condition under the pov of a Dietician
- Analyse individual feature, model patterns of Automobiles for visualisation
- Analyse stock prices to predict the performance of companies using an interactive dashboard

Each notebook in this course is incredibly detailed and collectively showcases the entire process of predictive analysis. Certain topics, like data wrangling, have additional associated notebooks to address the breadth of content covered in this course. 


## Key Topics

To illustrate each stage of the data analysis processes, the datasets included in this repository were utilised for analysis purposes. The primary aim of this course is to demonstrate a series of steps involved in inspecting, cleaning, transforming, and modeling data to extract valuable information and draw conclusions. Although the specific methodologies may vary based on the context and objectives, the dataset, comprising all the relevant information about the cars, was employed for the data analysis process, which typically includes the following key steps:

- Define objectives: Clearly defining the problem statements and objectives of the data analysis project and determining the desired insights to be derived from the dataset

- Data collection: Gathering relevant data from various datasets, including web scraping techniques, and ensuring data quality by addressing issues such as missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. Additionally, handling different file formats (ETL) is part of the process.

- Data Wrangling (preprocessing): Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis with the aid of certain Python modules such as Pandas & NumPy. Tasks include handling duplicates, addressing missing data, standardizing formats, and transforming variables.

- Data Exploration (AKA EDA): Exploring the dataset using descriptive statistics, visualization techniques, and summary metrics. Identifying patterns, trends, and relationships within the data.

- Data Modeling: Applying appropriate statistical or machine learning techniques to build predictive or explanatory models using certain modules such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, etc.. This includes regression, classification, clustering, or other methods depending on the nature of the dataset and objectives.

- Interpretation and inference: Analyzing the model results to extract meaningful insights and make data-driven decisions. Assessing the significance and validity of the findings, taking into account any limitations or assumptions.

- Reporting and visualization: Presenting the results in a clear and meaningful manner using visualizations and reports, ensuring the information is understandable and actionable.

- Iteration and refinement: The data analysis process is often iterative. Refining models, revisiting data preprocessing steps, and incorporating feedback to enhance the analysis and address any additional questions or concerns related to the automobile dataset.

By following these steps, the analysis of any dataset within this repository, would help extract valuable insights and provide a comprehensive understanding of the data.
